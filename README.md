# Bonk.io-checker

I have provided you with a combo and some proxies to test the checker, it is a gui based checker it sends post requests to the api and returns with valid or invalid and then it adds +1 to good or bad depending on the response. You can change the accounts by opening the txt file called accounts.txt and add your accounts to it and the same for proxies.
